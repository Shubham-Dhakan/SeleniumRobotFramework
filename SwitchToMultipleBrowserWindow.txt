Switching Multiple Browsers
    open browser    http://www.google.com/  chrome
    maximzie browser window

    sleep   3

    open browser    http://www.honda.ca/    chrome
    maximzie browser window


    # Switching multiple broswer starts from here:
    select browser  1           # <<< Select browser  1 >>>> is the key word and <<< 1 is index number >>> of browser
    ${title1}    = get title
    log to console  ${title1}

    select browser  2           # <<< Select Browser  2 >>> is the keyword & <<< 2 is index number >>> of browser
    ${title2}   = get title
    log to console  ${title2}


				#NOTE: In Selenium Robot Framework it super easy to change web browsers, just using <<< select browser 1 >>> with index number in
				this case "1" is index number, similarly we can open ( 2 browser just like that) and switch browsers.
